# Available Docker Images
This is a list of the docker images this repository creates:

| ‚öôÔ∏è Linux Flavor | üéÅ Version |
|------------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu        | [20.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/docker-baseimage-s6-overlay-ubuntu/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=20.04), [beta-20.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/docker-baseimage-s6-overlay-ubuntu/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=beta-20.04), [edge-{{PR number}}](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/docker-baseimage-s6-overlay-ubuntu/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated&name=edge)  |


# What is S6 Overlay?
[S6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) is a process supervisor that allows you to make any app disposable and repeatable within one container, even if you need two processes to run it (like PHP).

Instead of running [Supervisor](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor) inside of your container, S6 Overlay was built specifically for the lifecycle of containers -- giving you a more accurate way of bringing containers down and monitoring their health.

# Aren't you only supposed to run one process per container?
In a perfect world, yes. But this isn't a perfect world. See a great explanation called ["The Docker Way" by the S6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#the-docker-way) team for an excellent explaination.

### Usage
Simply use this image name pattern in any of your projects:
```sh
serversideup/docker-baseimage-s6-overlay-ubuntu:{{version}}
```
For example... If I wanted to run **Ubuntu 20.04**, I would use this image:
```sh
serversideup/docker-baseimage-s6-overlay-ubuntu:20.04
```

### Updates
‚úÖ The image builds automatically run weekly (Sunday at 0800 UTC) for latest security updates.

# Where do you host your stuff?
We get this question often. Our biggest principle is: **your infrastructure should be able to run anywhere.**

We believe privacy and control is the #1 priority when it comes to hosting infrastructure. We try to avoid the "big clouds" as much as possible because we're not comfortable that all 3 major players practice data mining of users and their products usually contain some sort of "vendor-lock".

We run all of our production servers on the latest LTS release of Ubuntu Server. The hosts we use are below. Some may be affiliate links that kick a few bucks at no extra cost to you, but they do not affect our recommendations at all. 

## [Vultr](https://vultr.grsm.io/create)
**Our current favorite.** Excellent performance and value. Lots of datacenter options too.

## [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/f3bad4b927ca)
Lots of developer love here. Not the best performing servers, but they do have a lot of awesome products!

## [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=5a1b585e4eb919d3d89ad242bd1bb2924754c444)
Great performance and great support. These guys have really enhanced their offering over the last few years.

### Benchmarks

# About this project
We're taking the extra effort to open source as much as we can. Not only could this potentially help someone learn a little bit of Docker, but it makes it a *heck of a lot* easier for us to work with you on new open source ideas.

### Special thanks
- @shinsenter: Thanks for your previous contributions and providing examples to make our images better.

# Submitting issues and pull requests
Since there are a lot of dependencies on these images, please understand that it can make it complicated on merging your pull request.

We'd love to have your help, but it might be best to explain your intentions first before contributing.

### Like we said -- we're always learning
If you find a critical security flaw, please open an issue or learn more about [our responsible disclosure policy](https://www.notion.so/Responsible-Disclosure-Policy-421a6a3be1714d388ebbadba7eebbdc8).

# Testing Github Actions Locally
If you want to test running Github Actions locally in development, we use [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act). After install, configure your ENV and then you can run:

```bash
act --secret-file .env [my-command]
```
